## About
Twilio Verify Push SDK helps you verify users by adding a low-friction, secure, cost-effective, "push verification" factor into your own mobile application. This fully managed API service allows you to seamlessly verify users in-app via a secure channel, without the risks, hassles or costs of One-Time Passcodes (OTPs).
This project provides an SDK to implement Verify Push for your iOS app.

<a name='Installation'></a>

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate TwilioVerify into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'TwilioVerify', '~> 0.4.0'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate TwilioVerify into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "twilio/twilio-verify-ios" -> 0.4.0
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but TwilioVerify does support its use on iOS.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding TwilioVerify as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.4.0"))
]
```


### Register Your App with APNs
If you want to receive challenges as push notifications, you should register Your App with APNs. More info [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns)

## Usage

---
**NOTE**

The SDK should be used from a Swift class.
See an example in the [TwilioVerifyAdapter class](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-ios/blob/main/TwilioVerifyDemo/TwilioVerifyDemo/TwilioVerify/TwilioVerifyAdapter.swift)

---

See [Verify Push Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts/push-ios) for a step-by-step guide to using this SDK in a basic Verify Push implementation.

<a name='SampleApp'></a>

## Running the Sample app

### To run the Sample App:
* Clone the repo
* Change the Bundle Identifier to something unique so Appleâ€™s push notification server can direct pushes to this app
* [Enable push notifications](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devdfd3d04a1)
* Get the Access token generation URL from your backend [(Running the Sample backend)](#SampleBackend). You will use it for creating a factor
* Run the `TwilioVerifyDemo` project using `Release` as build configuration

<a name='SampleBackend'></a>

## Running the Sample backend

* Clone this repo: https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend
* Configure a [Push Credential](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts/push-ios#create-a-push-credential) for the sample app, using the same APNs configuration
* Configure a [Verify Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts/push-ios#create-a-verify-service-and-add-the-push-credential), using the Push Credential for the sample app
* Run the steps in the [README file](https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend/blob/master/README.md)

<a name='UsingSampleApp'></a>

## Using the sample app

### Adding a factor
* Press Create factor in the factor list (click on the +, top right)
* Enter the identity to use. This value should be an UUID that identifies the user to prevent PII information use
* Enter the Access token URL (Access token generation URL, including the path, e.g. https://yourapp.ngrok.io/accessTokens)
* Press Create factor
* Copy the factor Sid

### Sending a challenge
* Go to Create Push Challenge page (/challenge path in your sample backend)
* Enter the `identity` you used in factor creation
* Enter the `Factor Sid` you added
* Enter a `message`. You will see the message in the push notification and in the challenge view
* Enter details to the challenge. You will see them in the challenge view. You can add more details using the `Add more Details` button
* Press `Create challenge` button
* You will receive a push notification showing the challenge message in your device. 
* The app will show the challenge info below the factor information, in a `Challenge` section
* Approve or deny the challenge
* After the challenge is updated, you will see the challenge status in the backend's `Create Push Challenge` view

<a name='Logging'></a>
## Logging
By default, logging is disabled. To enable it you can either set your own logging services by implementing [LoggerService](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-ios/blob/main/TwilioVerify/TwilioVerify/Sources/Logger/Logger.swift#L24) and calling `addLoggingService` (note that you can add as many logging services as you like) or enable the default logger service by calling `enableDefaultLoggingService`. Your multiple implementations and the default one can work at the same time, but you may just want to have it enabled during the development process, it's risky to have it turned on when releasing your app.
### Setting Log Level
You may want to log only certain processes that are happening in the SDK, or you just want to log it all, for that the SDK allows you to set a log level.
* error: reports behaviors that shouldn't be happening.
* info: warns specific information of what is being done.
* debug: detailed information.
* networking: specific data for the networking work, such as request body, headers, response code, response body.
* all: error, info, debug and networking are enabled.
### Usage
To start logging, enable the default logging service or/and pass your custom implementations
```swift
var builder = TwilioVerifyBuilder()
#if DEBUG
  builder = builder.enableDefaultLoggingService(withLevel: .all)
                   .addLoggingService(MyOwnLoggerService1())
                   .addLoggingService(MyOwnLoggerService2())
#endif
twilioVerify = try builder.build()
```

<a name='Errors'></a>

## Errors
Types | Code | Description
---------- | ----------- | -----------
Network | 60401 | Exception while calling the API
Mapping | 60402 | Exception while mapping an entity
Storage | 60403 | Exception while storing/loading an entity
Input | 60404 | Exception while loading input
Key Storage | 60405 | Exception while storing/loading key pairs
Initialization | 60406 | Exception while initializing an object
Authentication Token | 60407 | Exception while generating token

<a name='UpdatePushToken'></a>

## Update factor's push token
You can update the factor's push token in case it changed, calling the `TwilioVerify.updateFactor` method:
```swift
let updateFactorPayload = UpdatePushFactorPayload(sid: factorSid, pushToken: newPushToken)
twilioVerify.updateFactor(withPayload: payload, success: { factor in
  // Success
}) { error in
  // Error
}
```

See [FactorListPresenter](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-ios/blob/main/TwilioVerifyDemo/TwilioVerifyDemo/FactorList/Presenter/FactorListPresenter.swift#L90) in the sample app. You should update the push token for all factors.

<a name='DeleteFactor'></a>

## Delete a factor
You can delete a factor calling the `TwilioVerify.deleteFactor` method:
```swift
twilioVerify.deleteFactor(withSid: factorSid, success: {
  // Success
}) { error in
  // Error
}
```

<a name='ClearLocalStorage'></a>

## Clear local storage
You can clear the local storage calling the `TwilioVerify.clearLocalStorage` method:
```swift
do {
  try twilioVerify.clearLocalStorage()
} catch {
  // Handle error
}
```
### Important Notes

- Calling this method will not delete factors in **Verify Push API**, so you need to delete them from your backend to prevent invalid/deleted factors when getting factors for an identity.
- Since the Keychain is used for storage this method can fail if there is an error while doing the Keychain operation.
